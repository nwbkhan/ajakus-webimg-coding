Ajakus web to image coding



I have implemented this problem in **NodeJs** because i did not find this suitable to java, 
there are tons of libs present in Npm repository, Though i looked for JxBrowser(Java), 
but i don't find it suitable for this.

> Total time taken - 6 hr // this time all goes looking into documentation part because i am familiar with JS but not worked in NodeJs.

##Requirements

- requires `NodeJs > 8.0`



## Run
- `clone` this repo
- install packages `npm install`
- `node app.js` - will listen on `4000`




##Paths
| url | message |
| ------ | ------ |
| `/` | Simple App message |
| `/htmlToImg?url=url_name` | get the image for url |
